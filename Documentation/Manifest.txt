Fixed employee deselection
	UnitMouseEventManager.cs

Made it so that when you tell an employee to move while they're working, it updates their destination for after the work is done
	(also works with employees that are panicking/uncontrolable)
	UnitMouseEventManager.cs
	Sefira.cs

Employee selection add/subtract options
	(Is also an Overtime Reseach)
	Hold [shift] while selecting employees to add them to the current selection
	Hold [shift]+[alt] while selecting employees to remove them from the current selection
	Press [ctrl]+[+] to enter add selection mode
	Press [ctrl]+[-] to enter subtract selection mode
	Press [ctrl]+[0] to return to normal selection mode
	UnitMouseEventManager.cs

The ability to make control groups
	(Is also an Overtime Reseach)
	Press [ctrl]+[alt]+[1-9 or Z-M] to save the current selection
	Press [ctrl]+[1-9 or Z-M] to reselect those employees
		also works with [shift] or [shift]+[alt] to add/remove from the selection

	Control groups 1-9 are temporary, and are forgotten when you close the game
	Control groups Z-M are permanent, and save even when you close the game
	
	There are also a few static groups
		[ctrl]+[A] to select all employees
		[ctrl]+[W] to select all working employees
		[ctrl]+[S] to select all suppressing employees
		[ctrl]+[D] to select all idle employees

The ability to queue work orders
	(Is also an Overtime Reseach)
	Hold [shift] when clicking a containment unit to open the work menu in a special state
		always works, even when you couldn't normally open the work menu
	Clicking employees in this menu will queue a work order for them
		you can also hold [shift] to do it on a normal work menu
		it'll make a different sound than normal

	Holding [alt] when clicking a containment unit will cancel all work queued for them
		it will not cancel the current work order
	Holding [alt] when clicking an employee in the work menu will cancel all their queued works

	Each employee can have up to 3 works queued at a time
	Each abnormality can have up to 5 works queued at a time
	
	QueuedWorkOrder.cs

	RabbitUnit.cs

EGO gifts are now given after abnormality end of work checks
	(Used to be that obtaining EGO gifts from an abnormality
		that requires that en employee has less than a certain level in a stat
		would cause them to get angry if the EGO gift was enough to boost that employee to that level)
	UseSkill.cs

EGO gifts can now be locked/hidden during the day and regardless of employee level
	InGameUI.AgentGiftWindow.cs

Shortened words that were too long, making some text too small thus making it almost unreadable

	Your preferences automatically saved to your file

	The 'temp'orary version of each command does not save it at all, so it will be lost when you close the game
	The 'quiet' version of each command changes the persistant value without wiping the transient value
	For all of the changemode commands, you can also type the word 'reset' in the place of the value in order to reset it to its default state
