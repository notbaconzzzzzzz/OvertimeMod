Added config to turn certain preferences on and off
	Use console commands to turn options on and off
	Your preferences automatically saved to your file
	The 'trans'ient version of each command saves it to your current save instead of your profile, so reseting your data will reset them too
	The 'temp'orary version of each command does not save it at all, so it will be lost when you close the game
	The 'quiet' version of each command changes the persistant value without wiping the transient value
	For all of the changemode commands, you can also type the word 'reset' in the place of the value in order to reset it to its default state
