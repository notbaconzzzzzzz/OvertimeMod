Version 0.3.1

 - Made a quick fix so that Dont Touch Me no longer can delete EGO (it also means you can't get the observe info; can be reverted using a mode preferance)
 - Made it so that Meat Lantern can't spawn right outside its own containment unit
 - Fixed bug where Green Dusk accidentally had ALEPH level defense and fear damage
 - Finished implementing the core suppression ordeal spawning time restrictions for the middle and lower layers

 - Added the Dynamic Neutral Music feature (must be turned on; is not on by default)
 - Worked on the Tranquilizer Bullets

 - Added Unknown Abno Mode, which removes all information on the abnormality selection screen
 - Added Blind Mode, which makes it so that you literally cannot see during the day or on the deployment screen
