Meltdown of Pain
	-10% success rate
	work damage x1.5 +2 (work damage is multiplied by x1.5, then +2 is added to that)

	Up to 9 times, evenly spaced about 6 seconds apart (if meltdown timer is modified, interval adjusts accordingly)
	deal damage based on the abnormality's work damage to all employees in a radius
		Exact formulas:		Damage			Range
				1st-3rd	33% * work_damage + 3	25
				4th-6th	50% * work_damage + 4	33
				7th-9th	100% * work_damage + 6	45
				(if has no work damage, assume 2-6 P)
	Whenever a negative PE-Box is produced, deal damage to all employees in a radius (not including the employee working)
		The radius depends on the current work progress
		Exact formulas:		Damage			Range
				0-33%	16% * work_damage + 1	25
				33-66%	16% * work_damage + 1	33
				66-100%	16% * work_damage + 1	45

	Upon failing to resolve the meltdown, deal 10 R damage to all employees
		increase damage for each previously failed Overtime Meltdown that day
			by 1.5 R for Meltdowns of Pain
			by 0.5 R for every other type of Overtime Meltdown
Meltdown of Grief
	-25% success rate
	work cooldown timer x0.5

	As the meltdown timer decreases, gradually produce negative boxes, up to half of of the abnormality's PE maximum
	The work will start with these negative boxes already produced, and then continue from there
	The negative boxes produced this way will deal all their work damage when an employee when they start the work

	Upon failing to resolve the meltdown, deal 10 W damage to all employees
		increase damage for each previously failed Overtime Meltdown that day
			by 1.5 W for Meltdowns of Grief
			by 0.5 W for every other type of Overtime Meltdown
Meltdown of Ruin
	-15% success rate

	Every 1sec that the meltdown timer counts down, permanently reduce the starting meltdown timer by 1sec;
		Once the timer reduction on an abnormality reaches a total of 30sec, the rate gets halved to every 2sec.
	Positive E-Boxes do not produce any energy, and Negative E-Boxes produce -2 energy each.

	Upon failing to resolve the meltdown, deal 10 B damage to all employees
		increase damage for each previously failed Overtime Meltdown that day
			by 1.5 B for Meltdowns of Ruin
			by 0.5 B for every other type of Overtime Meltdown
Meltdown of Oblivion
	-5% success rate
	-40% work speed

	While the game is paused, the meltdown timer continues to count down (at double rate; x2.0 speed)
	If the abnormality is being worked on or is on work cooldown, but the game is paused,
		meltdown timer counts down (at normal rate; x1.0 speed), even though it normally doesn't in that scenario
	Employees who have been ordered to work on this abnormality have their movement speed reduced by -40%

	Upon failing to resolve the meltdown, deal 10 P damage to all employees
		increase damage for each previously failed Overtime Meltdown that day
			by 1.5 P for Meltdowns of Oblivion
			by 0.5 P for every other type of Overtime Meltdown
