Version 0.3.2

 - Fixed Silent Orchestra stealing energy on movement 4 instead of finale
 - Buffed Crimson and Cobalt Scar weapons
 - Redid the way the MapGraphFix works so that it should hopefully no longer make saves incompatible with vanilla

 - Big and Will be Bad Wolf no longer lowers his qliphoth counter at the start of the next day if you end the previous day with an employee still working on him
 - Big and Will be Bad Wolf now actually properly kills the eaten employees if you don't save them

 - Fixed a bug with my feature that's supposed to give you lower layer missions early so that you can always complete all Core Suppressions
